How to deploy?
-----------------
It's very easy to get your own Github About Page in two steps:

1. Fork repository [AndreLion/about](https://github.com/AndreLion/about)
2. Go to your gh-pages branch [https://github.com/*your-github-ID*/about/tree/gh-pages](https://github.com/your-github-ID/about/tree/gh-pages) and delete the file called delete_me.md in order to activate your github page.

Then, wait at most ten minutes till your own Github About Page has been shipped. The Url would be [http://*your-github-ID*.github.io/about/](http://your-github-ID.github.io/about/)
