Github About Page
================

Version 2.0

_Everything **about** yourself on Github._

This project helps you to build a **about** page to introduce all your information on Github, including your profile, public repositories and contribution frequency. All you need to do is to fork this repository then activate its gh-pages branch. Your **about** page is hosted under your own Github and you can show it to others as a clear and intuitive introduction of your work at Github.

Briefly speaking, Github official user profile page sucks, so I improved it and made it easy to use by others.

Take a quick glance at the **Github About Page** below as [an example](http://andrelion.github.io/about/) and you can [preview your own](http://andrelion.github.io/about/preview/).

How to get your own Github About Page?
-----------------
It's very easy, there are only two steps you need to do:

1. Fork me.
2. Activate the gh-pages by modifying the file called modify-me.md under your gh-pages branch [https://github.com/*your-github-ID*/about/tree/gh-pages](https://github.com/your-github-ID/about/tree/gh-pages).

Then, wait at most ten minutes till your own Github About Page has been shipped. 

The Url would be [http://*your-github-ID*.github.io/about/](http://your-github-ID.github.io/about/)


How to customise your own Github About Page?
-----------------
You can change your code to whatever you like because you have the ownership of the repository after you fork it. However, there are two ways to extend your Githua About Page easily:

1. config.json : in this file, you can extend your personal or repo information. For more details, plase check the comment in this file.
2. css/style.css : in the bottom of this file, you can add your own stylesheet to make you repo card perfectly shows in your Github About Page.


How to keep update?
-----------------
When there is a new version available, a notification will be shown on your **Github About Page**. Then you need to do some command work to make your Github About Page catching up the latest version.

1. [Syncing a fork in local](https://help.github.com/articles/syncing-a-fork).
2. [Pushing a branch to remote](https://help.github.com/articles/pushing-to-a-remote#pushing-a-branch).

Or, there is another eaiser method to do so:

1. Delete your **about** repository.
